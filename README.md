This game draws inspiration from another game that drew inspiration from the James Bond films and was originally supposed to carry the James Bond license, thanks to that game, we now have "From WDI 33 with Uncertainty!"

It has been made known to the world that there is a floppy disk that contains 1mb of data dangerous enough to crash the world wide web for everyone. In order to avoid this disk from falling into the wrong hands, the heads, J & J, of the secret intelligence service known as General Assembly have tasked two "Developers" in a race against one another to secure the disk and save the world.

As a "Developer" you need to ensure you get to the disk first and prove once and for all that you are the best around! To do this, you'll need to, as fast as you can, press your four keys in succession (A,S,D,F or J,K,L,;).

If you lose, then worry not, thankfully you'll live to die another day. However, if safety of the world is not enough, you can alway suse the experimental time portal, Click Try Again, and do your best to this time come out as the best "Developer!"
